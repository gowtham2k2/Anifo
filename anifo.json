To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"","season":"summer","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1287,"type":"anime","name":"Q-Tec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1287/Q-Tec"},{"mal_id":1334,"type":"anime","name":"Docomo Anime Store","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"},{"mal_id":1337,"type":"anime","name":"Medicos Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1337/Medicos_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1554,"type":"anime","name":"Contents Seed","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1554/Contents_Seed"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2232,"type":"anime","name":"ADK Marketing Solutions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2232/ADK_Marketing_Solutions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Reincarnation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":37210,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37210/Isekai_Maou_to_Shoukan_Shoujo_no_Dorei_Majutsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1649/93412l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"8a0gn8mmnaY","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a0gn8mmnaY","embed_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8a0gn8mmnaY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8a0gn8mmnaY/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8a0gn8mmnaY/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8a0gn8mmnaY/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8a0gn8mmnaY/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/8a0gn8mmnaY/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"The Otherworldly Demon King and the Summoner Girls' Slave Magic"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"異世界魔王と召喚少女の奴隷魔術"},{"type":"English","title":"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord"},{"type":"German","title":"How Not To Summon A Demon Lord"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"How not to Summon a Demon Lord"},{"type":"French","title":"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord"}],"title":"Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu","title_english":"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord","title_japanese":"異世界魔王と召喚少女の奴隷魔術","title_synonyms":["The Otherworldly Demon King and the Summoner Girls' Slave Magic"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2018-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":7,"year":2018},"to":{"day":20,"month":9,"year":2018}},"string":"Jul 5, 2018 to Sep 20, 2018"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.84,"scored_by":426625,"rank":4934,"popularity":277,"members":727831,"favorites":2515,"synopsis":"When it comes to the fantasy MMORPG Cross Reverie, none can match the power of the Demon King Diablo.
